# Variables

Some common variables that I use in my [Nix configuration](https://github.com/kiroris/nix-config).

- `nickname`: Nickname used in various contexts.
- `username`: Username for system login.
- `userfullname`: Full name of the user.
- `useremail`: Email address associated with the user.

```nix
nickname = "kiroris";
username = "kirill";
userfullname = "Kirill Shchirov";
useremail = "kiroris@proton.me";
```
